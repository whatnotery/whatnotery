# ***Hey Y'all!***

## My name is Jos and I'm a Rubyist & software developer in Lexington KY.

After coding on and off since I was a teenanger I spent the better part of a decade doing I.T. support at an enterprise level. After my IT career I pivoted to software engineering where I developed my skills in **Ruby** and **JavaScript** leading me to take on contract work and a full-time position as a support engineer. I started development work shortly there after and was quickly promoted to a development role. In this time, I’ve refined my skills with **Ruby on Rails**, testing with **RSpec** and **Capybara**, frontend development with **Svelte**, and **React**.

When I’m not coding, I find joy in being outside (walking, hiking, or cycling), listening to [my record collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/whatnotery), drinking natural wines, spending time with my partner, and serving on the board of directors of my [local bike co-op](https://www.thebrokespoke.org/).
